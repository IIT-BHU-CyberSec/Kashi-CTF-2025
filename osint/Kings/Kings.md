## Description
Did you know the cosmic weapons like this? I found similar example of such weapons on the net and it was even weirder. This ruler's court artist once drew the most accurate painting of a now extinct bird. Can you tell me the coordinates upto 10 decimal places of the place where this painting is right now.

## Solution 
On searching the image we get Tutankhamun's meteorite dagger. Then looking for other kings who had meteorite weapons, we get Jahangir. On searching his court artists we can see Ustad Mansur and his most accurate painting of extinct bird dodo. This painting is a prestent in Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia.
